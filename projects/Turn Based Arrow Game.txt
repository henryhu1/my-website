Inspired by games like Worms, this is a simple, two player, turn-based game.<br/>
Using the mouse to aim and spacebar to shoot,
players try hitting the opponent on the other side of a randomly generated terrain. There are also
random health restores and triple arrow power-ups that help the player if their arrow collides with said power-ups.
